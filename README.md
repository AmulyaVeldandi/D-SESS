# D-SESS-
The project aims to assess the side effect severity of medications used for specific diseases and rank them within a dataset. A machine learning model is employed to group medications based on their side effect severity and analyze their safety during pregnancy. The study utilizes statistical and analytical techniques, including the D-SESS scale, clustering algorithms, and machine learning models. The findings provide valuable insights into medication side effect severity and pregnancy safety, aiding clinicians and patients in informed decision-making. The project highlights the significance of employing multiple methods to gain a comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena.
